    "### Vector Math\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operations of vectors are performed member-by-member, i.e.,\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike Python, if the index is negative, **it will remove the member**\n",

    "\n",
    "We retrieve rows from a data frame with the single square bracket\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "We can retrieve a row by its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "mtcars[\"Camaro Z28\",] \n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can retrieve rows with a logical index vector. In the\n",
