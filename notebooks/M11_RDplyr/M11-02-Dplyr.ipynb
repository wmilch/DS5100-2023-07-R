    "# The `dplyr` package\n",
    "\n",
    "> Based on [Peng 2022](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dplyr` package was developed by Hadley Wickham of RStudio and is an\n",
    "optimized and distilled version of his `plyr` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `plyr` is an attempt to organize much of the functionality of the\n",
    "> `*apply` family of methods in R. Some of these methods are superseded\n",
    "> by dplyr and plyr, but [they remain\n",
    "> useful](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dplyr` package does not provide any “new” functionality to R per\n",
    "se, in the sense that everything `dplyr` does could already be done with\n",
    "base R, but it *greatly* simplifies existing functionality in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important contribution of the `dplyr` package is that it provides a\n",
    "“grammar” (in particular, verbs) for data manipulation and for operating\n",
    "on data frames. With this grammar, you can sensibly communicate what it\n",
    "is that you are doing to a data frame that other people can understand\n",
    "(assuming they also know the grammar). This is useful because it\n",
    "provides an abstraction for data manipulation that previously did not\n",
    "exist. Another useful contribution is that the `dplyr` functions are\n",
    "**very** fast, as many key operations are coded in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `dplyr` Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key “verbs” provided by the `dplyr` package are\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `select`: return a subset of the columns of a data frame, using a\n",
    "    flexible notation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `filter`: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on\n",
    "    logical conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `arrange`: reorder rows of a data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `rename`: rename variables in a data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `mutate`: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `summarise` / `summarize`: generate summary statistics of different\n",
    "    variables in the data frame, possibly within strata\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `%>%`: the “pipe” operator is used to connect multiple verb actions\n",
    "    together into a pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dplyr` package as a number of its own data types that it takes\n",
    "advantage of. For example, there is a handy `print` method that prevents\n",
    "you from printing a lot of data to the console. Most of the time, these\n",
    "additional data types are transparent to the user and do not need to be\n",
    "worried about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common `dplyr` Function Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the functions that we will discuss in this Chapter will have a\n",
    "few common characteristics. In particular,\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The first argument is a data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame\n",
    "    specified in the first argument, and you can refer to columns in the\n",
    "    data frame directly without using the \\$ operator (just use the\n",
    "    column names).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The return result of a function is a new data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Data frames must be properly formatted and annotated for this to all\n",
    "    be useful. In particular, the data must be\n",
    "    [tidy](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper). In short, there\n",
    "    should be one observation per row, and each column should represent\n",
    "    a feature or characteristic of that observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing the `dplyr` package\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dplyr` package can be installed from CRAN or from GitHub using the\n",
    "`devtools` package and the `install_github()` function. The GitHub\n",
    "repository will usually contain the latest updates to the package and\n",
    "the development version.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install from CRAN, just run\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r,eval=false}\n",
    "install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install from GitHub you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r,eval=false}\n",
    "install_github(\"hadley/dplyr\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the package it is important that you load it into your\n",
    "R session with the `library()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "library(dplyr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may get some warnings when the package is loaded because there are\n",
    "functions in the `dplyr` package that have the same name as functions in\n",
    "other packages. For now you can ignore the warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for\n",
    "the [city of\n",
    "Chicago](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/leanpub/rprog/chicago_data.zip)\n",
    "in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You will find the data in the directory for this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the data into R using the `readRDS()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "chicago <- readRDS(\"chicago.rds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the `select()` function to **select columns you want to focus\n",
    "on**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to take the first 3 columns only.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could for example use numerical indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "names(chicago)[1:3]\n",
    "```\n",

    "But we can also use the names directly.\n",

    "``` {r}\n",
    "chicago %>%\n",
    "  select(city:dptp)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the use of `:` inside the `select()` — you can use it to specify a\n",
    "range of variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also *omit* variables using the `select()` function by using\n",
    "**the negative sign**. With `select()` you can do\n",

    "``` {r,eval=false}\n",
    "select(chicago, -(city:dptp))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that we should include every variable *except* the\n",
    "variables `city` through `dptp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent code in base R would be\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r,eval=false}\n",
    "i <- match(\"city\", names(chicago))\n",
    "j <- match(\"dptp\", names(chicago))\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not super intuitive, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `select()` function also allows a special syntax that allows you to\n",
    "specify **variable names based on patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, if you wanted to keep every variable that ends with a\n",
    "“2”, we could do\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "chicago %>%\n",
    "  select(ends_with(\"2\"))\n",
